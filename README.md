# About Me Lab

## About Me

I built an "About Me" webpage that contains my educational background, my work experience, my top 10 favorite activites, goals, a yes or no guessing game, a number guessing game, and a guessing game of the places I've lived with an array. I integrated a scoring system to keep track of the correct answers and relay that to the user after all questions have been answered.
